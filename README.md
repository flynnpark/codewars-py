<summary>003. Find The Parity Outlier</summary>

#### [Codewars Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5526fc09a1bbd946250002dc)

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer `N`. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" `N`.

### Examples

```
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)
```

<summary>002. Find the odd int</summary>

Given an array, find the integer that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

<summary>001. Replace With Alphabet Position</summary>

#### [Codewars Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/546f922b54af40e1e90001da)

Welcome.

In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

`"a" = 1`, `"b" = 2`, etc.

Example

```python
alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
```

Should return `"20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"`(as a string)
